## Abstract

This study introduces "screenomics" - a novel digital phenotyping approach that captures smartphone activity via screenshots - to examine passive and active data (obtained via ecological momentary assessment) in the days prior to psychiatric hospitalization for suicidal crises.

## Key Innovation

**Screenomics Methodology:**
- Digital phenotyping through automated smartphone screenshots
- Passive data collection without user burden
- Real-time monitoring of smartphone usage patterns
- Integration with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data

## Research Significance

- **First Application**: Novel use of screenomics technology for suicide risk prediction
- **Digital Mental Health**: Major advance in passive monitoring for psychiatric crises
- **Clinical Utility**: Potential for real-time risk assessment and intervention
- **Methodological Innovation**: Combines passive and active data collection methods

## Clinical Implications

This research demonstrates the potential for:
- Early warning systems for psychiatric crises
- Objective assessment of mental health status
- Reduced burden on patients through passive monitoring
- Integration with existing clinical care pathways

## Future Directions

The screenomics approach opens new possibilities for:
- Large-scale digital mental health monitoring
- Personalized risk prediction models
- Just-in-time adaptive interventions
- Understanding behavioral patterns preceding crises
