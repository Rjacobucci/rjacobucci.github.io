## Abstract

Machine learning techniques have gained popularity in psychological research for their flexibility in model fitting and superior predictive performance. However, measurement errors prevent machine-learning algorithms from accurately modeling nonlinear relationships, if indeed they exist. Through simulated examples, we demonstrate that model selection between a machine-learning algorithm and regression depends on measurement quality, regardless of sample size.

## Key Findings

- **Measurement Quality is Critical**: "Garbage in, garbage out" principle applies crucially to machine learning in psychology
- **Nonlinear Relationships**: ML algorithms struggle to detect true nonlinear relationships when measurement error is present
- **Sample Size Limitations**: Even large samples cannot overcome poor measurement quality
- **Model Selection Impact**: Choice between ML and traditional regression depends heavily on measurement reliability

## Research Impact

- **Highly Cited**: Ranks in top 25% of all research outputs on Altmetric
- **Methodological Influence**: Changed how researchers think about ML applications in psychology
- **Replication Implications**: Highlights why ML "promise" has been "somewhat unmet" in psychology

## Practical Implications

This work demonstrates that before applying sophisticated machine learning algorithms, psychological researchers must first ensure high-quality measurement. The findings suggest that improving measurement instruments may be more valuable than developing more complex algorithms.
