## Advancing Mental Health Through Machine Learning

I'm a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, pioneering the intersection of machine learning and clinical psychology. With **2,668+ citations** and cutting-edge research in digital phenotyping, I develop computational methods that transform how we understand and predict mental health crises.

### üéØ Current Focus: Digital Mental Health Innovation

**Leading Research:** I'm at the forefront of "screenomics" - using passive smartphone data to predict psychiatric hospitalization and suicide risk. My work bridges the critical gap between complex ML algorithms and practical clinical applications.

**Key Achievement:** Developed novel methods for analyzing real-time digital biomarkers from smartphone screenshots, advancing our ability to intervene before mental health crises occur.

### üí° Research Impact Areas

**Digital Phenotyping & Risk Prediction**
- Pioneering smartphone-based passive data collection for suicide risk assessment
- Creating ML models that analyze ecological momentary assessments in real-time
- Building custom foundation models for multimodal patient data

**Clinical Machine Learning Applications**
- Natural language processing for clinical text analysis
- Longitudinal subtype identification using advanced ML techniques
- Integration of measurement error assessment into predictive models

**Methodological Innovation**
- Author of *Machine Learning for Social and Behavioral Research* (2023)
- Developer of regularized structural equation modeling techniques
- Expert in translating complex computational methods for clinical practitioners

### üìä By the Numbers
- **2,668+** research citations
- **50+** peer-reviewed publications
- **Leading author** on groundbreaking digital mental health studies
- **Active grants** in suicide prevention and digital health

### ü§ù Let's Connect

I'm passionate about collaborations that advance mental health through technology. Whether you're interested in research partnerships, consulting, or learning more about my work:
