I am a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research focuses on clinical methodology, specializing in machine learning applications for psychological research. I develop computational methods to understand psychological phenomena, with particular emphasis on suicide risk factors and the analysis of multimodal patient data.

My research interests include:
- Natural language processing and large language models for clinical applications  
- Machine learning approaches to understanding suicide risk factors
- Computational methods for analyzing smartphone usage and ecological momentary assessments
- Custom foundation models for patient data processing
- Integrating measurement error assessment into machine learning frameworks
- Longitudinal subtype identification using machine learning

I create machine learning solutions that bridge the gap between complex computational methods and practical clinical applications, helping to advance our understanding of psychological research through data-driven approaches.
