## Open Source Software & Tools

This page showcases R packages and computational tools developed for psychological research, structural equation modeling, and machine learning applications.

## R Packages

### regsem
Allows ridge or lasso penalties on parameters in structural equation models. This package implements regularization methods for SEM as described in Jacobucci, Grimm, & McArdle (2016).

**Resources:**
- [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/regsem) - Community support and discussions
- [Tutorial](http://rpubs.com/RJacobucci/351598) - Getting started guide

### dtree
A flexible decision tree package that combines features from multiple decision tree algorithms. This package allows users to run and compare multiple algorithms and includes a `stable()` function that uses bootstrap replications for enhanced model stability.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple algorithm comparison
- Bootstrap-based stability assessment
- Unified interface for different tree methods

### longRPart2
An updated version of the original longRPart package that creates subgroups based on mixed effects models. This package extends recursive partitioning methods to longitudinal data contexts.

**Applications:**
- Longitudinal data subgroup identification
- Mixed effects model-based partitioning

### MplusTrees
Uses recursive partitioning to create homogeneous subgroups based on structural equation models fitted in Mplus. This package bridges tree-based methods with latent variable modeling.

**Features:**
- Integration with Mplus software
- SEM-based subgroup identification
- Recursive partitioning for latent variable models
